## 🌐 API Integration

To make the Google Gemini API work, you need to:

1. Obtain an API key from Google.
2. Add the API key to the `.env` file:
   ```
   REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. Ensure that your API key has access to the required Google Gemini endpoints.

## 💡 Key Learning Outcomes

- **React Hooks**: Usage of `useState` and `useEffect` for state management.
- **API Integration**: Fetching and handling data from third-party APIs.
- **Responsive Design**: Building a mobile-friendly and responsive UI with CSS.
